# Original static-mesh actor bounds

The browser now reproduces the original nonnull-owner
`UStaticMesh.GetCollisionBoundingBox` method, including its cylinder branch,
transformed local box and conditional auxiliary collision-model union.
`static-sweep.js` reuses the same original eight-corner box transform.

Elbera Tools compares **600 bounding-box cases** and **288 actor updates across
8 sequences** with retained Interlude instructions. The joined comparison
executes the original primitive selector, static bounds, cached-box preparation,
level-mode selection, insertion and removal. It checks ordered membership,
method calls, sparse writes and bitwise Float32 cache values. Results include
200 insertions, 24 root rejections, 40 skipped updates and 24 removals:
2,314,902 instructions at 1,725 addresses in total.

These are authored finite component cases. Current live actor fields, resource
state and transforms remain required before this becomes world collision.
The work does not establish corrected NPC placement or playable maps.

## Runtime contract

The existing `editor/world/js/actor-primitive-bounds.js` exports:

```js
const result = prepareStaticMeshBounds({
  arithmeticProfile: "pc53-rne",
  ownerFlags2f8,
  ownerIdentity,
  localBounds: { min, max },
  collisionModel,
  readLocalToWorld,
  getCollisionModelBounds,
  // Consumed by the cylinder branch only:
  location, collisionRadius, collisionHeight,
});
```

All consumed vectors/matrices contain dense, finite Float32 values in original
axes and units. Flags are unsigned DWORDs; references are explicit identities
or null. Undefined means unresolved. Helper replies are synchronous:

| Helper | Response |
| --- | --- |
| `readLocalToWorld(ownerIdentity)` | `{status: "ready", matrix}` with the current 16-component row matrix |
| `getCollisionModelBounds(modelIdentity, ownerIdentity)` | `{status: "ready", bounds: {min, max, valid}}`; `valid` is the source byte |

Owner flag `+0x2f8 & 0x100` selects the existing generic cylinder box, including
its separately rounded radius/height plus one. That branch consumes no mesh
box, transform or auxiliary model. Its nonnull-owner dimensions remain limited
to finite nonnegative inputs.

Otherwise, LocalToWorld runs before reading the current mesh box. The original
Core transform visits all eight corners and stores each transformed component
as Float32 after the ordered Y, X, Z and translation terms. Source-box validity
is not consumed. The result is rebuilt from the corners with validity one;
strict comparisons retain earlier values on ties, including signed zero.
Singular matrices do not require an invented inverse.

After transformation, an explicit null collision model returns that result.
A nonnull model invokes its current bounding-box method. The original
`FBox += FBox` has an unusual rule: **an invalid right-hand box replaces the
whole result**, including its validity byte. A valid auxiliary box contributes
strict min/max comparisons. There is no additional final padding in this method;
[octree expansion](native-actor-admission-evidence.md) is a later operation.

The helper returns an immutable `{status: "ready", bounds: {min, max, valid}}`
or an explicit unsupported result. It preserves finite inverted auxiliary
bounds when the native copy branch returns them. The existing actor-admission
API accepts only ordered bounds, so joined comparisons supply ordered boxes;
this does not claim admission parity for malformed or inverted boxes.

`transformOriginalBox({arithmeticProfile, bounds, matrix})` exposes the shared
Core calculation. Mesh sweep preparation continues to compute its extent from
the transformed box using the original subsequent Float32 stores. All 800
existing source sweep comparisons pass after replacing the duplicate loop.

## Sources and reproducibility

The checker requires the same privately held Interlude Engine/Core edition as
the other collision tools. All four files are pinned:

| Input | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- |
| Owned Engine.dll | `07b24af4ab55e4230d0a7949df5b07565319e62a1b20f38fefb16ebe54821ad0` |
| Owned Core.dll | `9462f87a5e77d21865e2e00264efd44df25feb47aa78f8a72e9cf66ce4e919bf` |
| Supplemental Engine.dll | `508974c711f207402719e92737e211a2f029c95c2f68fc0e1c31fcbb9dbb232d` |
| Supplemental Core.dll | `d83449b1cdf0ac717a98be9289caab03cb507324a696ef449e31369e28416639` |

```sh
python3 tools/ui/check_static_actor_bounds_native.py \
  --comparison-engine /local/comparison/engine.dll \
  --comparison-core /local/comparison/Core.dll --check
```

Owned inputs default to `assets/interlude/system/engine.dll` and `Core.dll`;
`--engine` and `--core` override them. Capstone 5.0.7 and Node.js are required.
Without `--check`, stdout includes source qualification and current verifier,
runtime and dependency hashes. `--runtime-module` selects an alternate
`actor-primitive-bounds.js` beside its actor-octree dependencies. The checker
interprets qualified instructions; it never loads or executes the DLLs natively.

Qualification binds the complete normal static-box path
`106fe719..106fe7dd` to the supplemental body shifted by -64, including the
named erased Core calls and direct generic-box call. The retained SEH prefix
supplies ordinary frame effects; handler execution/unwinding is excluded.
Named UStaticMesh, AActor and AStaticMeshActor vtable slots bind the box and
LocalToWorld methods. Supplemental correspondence does not authenticate the
archive's origin or establish the protected client's runtime restoration.

The following Core bodies are compared byte for byte and interpreted:

| Method | Body, exclusive end |
| --- | --- |
| Default FBox constructor | `1010ef70..1010ef73` |
| FBox.TransformBy(FMatrix) | `10117dd0..10117f26` |
| FMatrix destructor | `101111e0..101111e1` |
| FBox += FBox | `10117a00..10117b62` |
| FBox += FVector | `101177f0..10117954` |

The default box constructor does not initialize the box. The interpreter keeps
unwritten padding partially unknown instead of zero-filling it. Comparisons
cover the six coordinates and validity byte; unknown padding reads fail.

The joined run reuses the [actor-admission interpreter](native-actor-admission-evidence.md)
and its explicit null GLog, non-editor, successful-storage and finite PC53/RNE
conditions. Native LocalToWorld and auxiliary subclass bodies are **supplied
method responses** in this checker, not executed internals. Those boundaries,
exception behavior and other FPU profiles remain outside its evidence.

Portable checks require no original files:

```sh
node --test editor/world/test/static-actor-bounds.test.mjs
python3 -m unittest discover -s tools/ui -p test_static_actor_bounds_native.py
```

Ten browser-module tests cover rounding, corner extrema, validity, signed-zero
ties, lazy field reads, unknown inputs, and actor removal/reentry. Four
interpreter tests cover method arguments, return buffers, stack cleanup,
unknown targets and opaque padding. The related 89 browser-module tests pass.
Local deliberate mutations of the invalid-box rule, cylinder flag, intermediate
rounding and equal-maximum comparison are rejected by the original comparison.

A browser startup smoke reached the offline world without captured errors;
the resulting screenshot was inspected. This is a startup regression check,
not an Online world-collision acceptance run. No new interface screenshot is
claimed for this headless component. This Elbera tool is repository source and
is not yet included in the existing standalone release archives.

## Next integration boundary

`localBounds` must be the **current native mesh field**, not a box recomputed
from rendered vertices. The [source exporter](native-static-sweep-evidence.md#saved-mesh-bounds) now
retains both serialized writes with exact offsets and hashes; the later box
overwrites the first. Both records agree for all 480 checked per-map meshes.
A qualified PostLoad gate can call Build, so source bytes alone still do not
establish later post-load mutations or current bounds.

Live actor population, original current transforms/flags, concrete primitive
query dispatch, auxiliary model implementations and movement callbacks remain
unfinished. This component removes one dependency from the faithful browser
port; it does not complete that goal.
